# botw-unloaded-magnesis

A few aims of this project:
*Find a correlation between the characteristics of world loads during Magnesis BtB and whether Magnesis Shrine is unloaded or loaded.
*Predict whether or not a speedrunner has gotten an unloaded or loaded shrine based on their magnesis btb footage.
*Allow BotW speedrunning community to understand unloaded Magnesis Shrine, providing a "baseline" for future research to determine whether manipulation is possible.
