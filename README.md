# botw-unloaded-magnesis

A few aims of this project:
* Find a correlation between the characteristics of world loads during Magnesis BTB and whether Magnesis Shrine is unloaded or loaded.
* Predict whether or not a speedrunner has gotten an unloaded or loaded shrine based on their Magnesis BTB footage.
* Allow the BotW speedrunning community to understand unloaded Magnesis Shrine, providing a "baseline" for future research to determine whether manipulation is possible.
